I was honored to spend some time with Benjamin Sehl, Senior Product Lead at Shopify, to discuss the ButcherBox e-commerce platform migration to Shopify.

I'm proud of how we were able to take an incremental approach to the migration, allowing us to start creating customer subscriptions in Shopify while using many of our existing software systems.

Through this project, the entire engineering team at ButcherBox delivered an enormous amount of value to the business without getting in the way of the customers. All of our existing members were migrated without their knowledge, and new members had access to the same features that ButcherBox is known for. **Free Bacon for Life** anyone?
