## hi there! üëãüèª

I've always been interested in computers, but it took some time before I discovered programming.

My formal training is as a mental health counselor. I attended an accelerated program in Cambridge, MA with the intention of being a therapist. All throughout, I was also working in IT.

While working in an Educational Technology Support position, my manager, who was a software engineer, gave me the space to learn a little bit of code. From that point on, I was hooked. I audited Harvard's CS-50 and was found myself disappointed, for the first time, that I had finished my homework each week.

The road to my first developer job involved a Pacific Coast bicycle tour, the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.com, and finally a fortunate connection with a RFID firmware engineer who got me an internship at Impinj, an RFID company in Seattle.

Family brought me back home to the East Coast where I've worked multiple web development jobs for Harvard University before arriving at ButcherBox where I got my first exposure to e-commerce.

After more than four years at ButcherBox I've had the privilege of watching a company on a rapid growth curve figure out how to build for the web while staying true to its values. I've grown at ButcherBox from a frontend engineering role all the way to a principal role as I assumed technical leadership of our e-commerce platform migration onto Shopify.

## Giving back ü§ó

I've had some fantastic mentorship over the years and I want to find a way to give back. That's the goal behind this blog. I am passionate about software craft, automated testing, e-commerce tech, scalable abstraction patterns, and learning strategies that help you grow as a developer. That's what you'll find here on this blog.

## AI Disclaimer ü§ñ

I'll be clear: none of the prose in my blog posts is written or influenced by AI. While I do use AI tools for auto-completion of code while I'm writing my blog posts, all post ideas and prose within the posts are written by me. I do use AI tools to assist in writing SEO descriptions based on the articles themselves, after they are written.
